reconscripts is designed to provide a basic level of automation
for performing initial recon tasks during a pen-test engagement.
I created this while working through Offensive Security's
OSCP labs and it is in no way designed to be used commercially,
professionally, maliciously or for anything other than doing
grunt work in a lab. If you've come here before you understand
what the various steps this script performs, you're in the wrong
place. Sparta does a better job than this.
